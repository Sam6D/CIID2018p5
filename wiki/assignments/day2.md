##Bowl of definitions:
Take the definition/concept you picked out of the hat.
Make a sketch that communicates a metaphor for it.
[Favorite example](http://taeyoonchoi.com/2014/12/3771/)

##Working on the interface concepts:
How will the person interact with your interface? 
How will it be "performed"?

What is the input? Feel free to try to find some examples of this. Google p5+ (your input) or look at the other [p5 libraries](https://p5js.org/libraries/) or look at [p5 examples](https://p5js.org/examples/). 

* mouse press, mouse click, keyboard, keyboard arrows
* camera, sound (sensed in room), image, mobile device (tricky to play certain sound though)

Why/How does the output (sound) relate to the input? Feel free to try to find some examples of this. Google sound + your output type of sound. Or check [this list](https://github.com/joshuajnoble/CIID2018p5/tree/master/wiki/music).

* are they (the people who will experience your instrument) controlling it / creating it / uncovering it / passively experiencing it?

What kind of sound are you working with?

* recorded by you (cityscape sound?)
* song you downloaded?
* mix of notes you are composing by interacting?
* melodic, dissonant or non-musical?

Is it a visualisation of sound or just an interface to the sound creation or control?

Who or what plays it?
What kind of emotion should the person interacting feel?
Do they have control or does your program have control? Either way, how much? Is there an exchange?
