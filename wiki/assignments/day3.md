SCOPING YOUR PROJECT
1. What are the components of your program?
    * Sound(s) - for example, finding nature songs, exploring oscillator sounds and finding ranges that work well
    * Inputs(s) - for example, mouse clicks, mic input
2. What are the steps you need to take to achieve the final concept?
    * Each step should be extremely concrete - for example, drawing 4 squares in a grid 
3. What is the biggest challenge you foresee?
    * How can you deal with it? Is there a friend who can help or can you come up with a clever hack?
4. Find a few reference projects on p5 examples that do similar things as what you are trying to do. 
    * For example: If I am trying to make a program that knows when the person has hovered over a square, I will look for a p5 example about interactivity where when a person hovers over a square, the square changes etc.  
5. REMEMBER: this will be performed / played with. What does that look like? You can add a little wizard of oz spice to the experience if you want, but most of your idea should work.
