* Live coding - learning together
    - Drawing exercises
    - Coding exercises - hands-on in pairs
* Review + peer-teaching - sharing solutions

Monday - 

  * Explain the course and divide up
    - Introduction to us / to you
      + Plan for the week
      + Plan for today
    - Why learn to code at all?
      - More efficient way to draw / Can be generative / Real-time reactivity / the “ooh” / Combines with data well / Can access and play with unusual aspects of the “user experience” - i.e., sound, location, camera
    - What's processing? What's p5? [Shiffman on history of processing + p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=1)
      + How about this Arduino thing? MAX?
    - What about this browser?
      + Landscape of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
      + Is p5 JavaScript?
    - Get set up: we could use the [web editor for p5.js](https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/)
  * [Variables](/CIID2018p5/variables)
    - Local vs. global
    - Why use a variable? 
  * Sketching Jam on Interfaces
    - What a computer understands. Peanut butter + jelly sandwich exercise.
  * Basic Drawing
    - Drawing with numbers and colors
    - Shape functions (a rect is a function)
    - Exercise: draw an ice cream cone
      + Part 1: instructions
      + Part 2: code it
    - (maybe): setup and draw: what's the difference?
  * Loading Images

Friday - 

  * Work on your project!
  * Afternoon: performance

###Friday Project -
(HOW WILL THEY PRESENT THEIR PLAN TO US?)
Keep it simple, small and something you have "Scoped". 
Imagine the project is for yourself, a family member, a friend. Big ideas can be sketched for the future.

In mind:

  - Who is this for? How do you hope they will use it? What will it make them feel?

On paper:

1. What is the input? What is the output? 
  -  Sketch the system
2. What is your first step? (2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc)
3. What wll you need help with? Who can help you?
4. What inspired you to do this?
