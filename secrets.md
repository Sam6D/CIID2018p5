    - Introduction to us / to you
      + Plan for the week
      + Plan for today
    - Why learn to code at all?
      - More efficient way to draw / Can be generative / Real-time reactivity / the “ooh” / Combines with data well / Can access and play with unusual aspects of the “user experience” - i.e., sound, location, camera
    - What's processing? What's p5? [Shiffman on history of processing + p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=1)
      + How about this Arduino thing? MAX?
    - Get set up: we could use the [web editor for p5.js](https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/)
    - The environment / the “grid” / comments / “built-in” / syntax / errors / shapes / [variables](/CIID2018p5/variables)
    - Setup / the canvas size / color mode / background / global variables / local variables / draw
    - Interface sketching jam
    - Pseudo-code / if statements / talking computer talk
    - Interface pseudo-code
    - P5 / the browser / libraries
      + Landscape of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
      + Is p5 JavaScript?

### Friday Project -

(HOW WILL THEY PRESENT THEIR PLAN TO US?)
Keep it simple, small and something you have "Scoped". 
Imagine the project is for yourself, a family member, a friend. Big ideas can be sketched for the future.

In mind:

  - Who is this for? How do you hope they will use it? What will it make them feel?

On paper:

1. What is the input? What is the output? 
  -  Sketch the system
2. What is your first step? (2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc)
3. What will you need help with? Who can help you?
4. What inspired you to do this?
