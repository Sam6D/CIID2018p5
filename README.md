#### COMMUNICATION CHANNELS
Slack

#### EXPECTATIONS -
Studio culture:

  * Be on time. This means 7 minutes early, in your chair, with your coffee, ready to participate
  * Do the assignment. Listen to each other present. Be ready to ask a question, comment and discuss each other's questions and work
  * YOU are creating the knowledge and learning and teaching of the course

Code culture:

  * We learn from each other. Share your bugs, triumphs and questions
  * To learn something new, first read about it, then try it out, then teach it to others
  * Post on slack the following two reflections:
      - “I don’t know how to…”
      - “I figured it out - here’s how you can do it…”
  * Trust the process - learn through doing, repetition until the concept becomes a habit
  * Confused? 
    1. First draw or write your question. Really. 
    2. Then check the reference to figure out the most simple part of your question. 
    3. If it doesn’t help, then ask a friend. 
    4. If no friend, see if you can simplify even more. 
    5. If still confused, ask us (the instructors)
All question and all answers are valuable

Learning hopes:

  * Get familiar with the p5.js coding environment
  * Computational design, drawing, sound
  * Appreciation for the medium - appreciate and understand programming as a tool and a medium
  * Sketching with code - learn the role and potential of programming within the design process
  * How to structure and plan your code-based concepts
  * Managing teamwork, expectation and workflow when collaboratively programming
  * Tips and tricks for handling and learning from errors

Deliverables / Milestones:

  * Collaborative project design, development and implementation
  * Evening exercises completion and reflection
  * Capture the experiences you have created - either screen-capture and/or mixed with personal experience
